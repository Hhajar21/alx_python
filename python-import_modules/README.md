Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should have a solid grasp of the following topics:

General
Why Python programming is awesome: Understand the unique features and strengths of Python as a programming language.

How to import functions from another file: Learn how to import functions and modules from external files to reuse code efficiently.

How to use imported functions: Know how to utilize the functions and modules imported from external files in your own Python programs.

How to create a module: Learn the process of creating your own modules in Python to organize and encapsulate code.

How to use the built-in function dir(): Understand the usage of the dir() function to explore the attributes and methods of objects.

How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported: Know the techniques to prevent specific code blocks from running when a script is imported as a module.

How to use command-line arguments with your Python programs: Learn how to handle command-line arguments passed to your Python scripts, allowing for dynamic behavior.

What’s the difference between errors and exceptions: Understand the distinction between syntax errors and exceptions in Python.

What are exceptions and how to use them: Get acquainted with exceptions, which are raised during runtime to handle unexpected situations.

When do we need to use exceptions: Learn the scenarios in which using exceptions is beneficial for handling errors and unexpected behaviors.

How to correctly handle an exception: Grasp the techniques for handling exceptions gracefully to prevent program crashes.

What’s the purpose of catching exceptions: Understand the importance of catching exceptions to handle them properly and maintain program stability.

How to raise a builtin exception: Learn how to raise built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions when needed.

When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception: Understand the concept of clean-up actions that should be performed even if an exception occurs.

Requirements
To effectively work on this project, ensure the following:

Recommended editor: Visual Studio Code: Use Visual Studio Code for writing, editing, and managing your Python code and files.

Python version: All your files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).

Line endings: Make sure all your files end with a new line to adhere to coding standards.

README.md file: Create a README.md file at the root of the project folder. This is mandatory and will serve as a documentation guide.

PEP 8 style: Follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.*) for writing clean and well-formatted Python code.

File length: Your code's file lengths will be tested using the wc command.

Additional Notes
Feel free to explore the provided resources in any order you prefer. It is recommended to take notes and practice the concepts through coding exercises to reinforce your understanding.

Happy learning and coding!
