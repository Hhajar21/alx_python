Python - Classes and Objects
This project covers the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of OOP and how to work with classes and objects in Python. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of various OOP concepts and how to use them effectively in your Python programs.

Background Context
OOP is a crucial concept in programming, and this project will provide you with a hands-on experience of working with classes and objects. It's essential to read all the provided resources and experiment with OOP concepts on your own. Don't just copy and paste code; type it, test it, and truly understand how it works.

Resources
Before starting the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources in the given order:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod, and staticmethod yet).
Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: some paragraphs show improper class implementation to help you understand concepts better. Read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON'T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The init Method, "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding," "Public, Protected, and Private Attributes").
Properties vs. Getters and Setters

Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external references:

Why Python programming is awesome
What is OOP
"First-class everything"
What is a class
What is an object and an instance
Difference between a class and an object or instance
What is an attribute
How to use public, protected, and private attributes
What is self
What is a method
The special init method and how to use it
Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
What is a property
Difference between an attribute and a property in Python
Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
Binding attributes to objects and classes
dict of a class and/or instance of a class and what it contains
How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
How to use the getattr function
Requirements
Recommended text editor: Visual Studio Code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have documentation (use python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (use python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (use python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
Note: Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstrings as comments following the Google Style Python Docstrings format.

More Info
Documentation is essential to help others (and yourself) understand your code. Make sure to provide clear explanations of the purpose and usage of each module, class, and function. It will make your code more maintainable and help you become a better programmer.
