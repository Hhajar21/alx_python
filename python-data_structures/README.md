Overview
This project focuses on learning about lists, tuples, and sequences in Python programming. By the end of this project, you will gain an understanding of the following concepts without the need for external assistance:

General
Appreciate why Python programming is considered awesome and its advantages.
Understand the fundamentals of lists and how to use them effectively.
Recognize the differences and similarities between strings and lists.
Familiarize yourself with common methods used with lists and how to implement them.
Apply lists as both stacks and queues.
Understand list comprehensions and how to utilize them for concise code.
Grasp the concept of tuples and their appropriate use cases.
Differentiate between tuples and lists, knowing when to use each.
Understand the notion of a sequence and its role in Python.
Comprehend tuple packing and how it works.
Explore sequence unpacking and its practical applications.
Learn about the del statement and its usage in Python.

Requirements
To work on this project, make sure you have the following:

Python Scripts: You'll be writing Python code to practice the concepts discussed in the resources above.

Recommended Editor: It is suggested to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor for a smooth development experience.

Environment: All your Python files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).

File Formatting: Ensure that all your Python files end with a new line to maintain consistency.

README.md: A mandatory README.md file should be present at the root of your project folder. This README will contain relevant information about the project, including how to set it up and run the code.

PEP 8 Style: Follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.*) to maintain a consistent and clean coding style throughout your project.

File Length Testing: The length of your Python files will be tested using the wc command, so keep your code organized and concise.

Conclusion
Upon completing this project and studying the recommended resources, you will have gained a solid understanding of lists, tuples, and sequences in Python. These fundamental data structures will prove essential in various programming tasks and provide a solid foundation for further Python development. Enjoy your learning journey!
