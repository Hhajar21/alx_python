API Python Project
Introduction
This project involves building Python scripts to access employee data via an API, organize it, and export it to different data structures. The goal is to replace traditional Bash scripting with more efficient Python code. This project will help you understand the concepts of APIs, REST APIs, microservices, data formats (CSV and JSON), and Python coding style.

Background Context
Old-school system administrators often rely on Bash scripting, but this can become messy and inefficient for complex tasks. Modern System Reliability Engineers (SREs) are akin to software engineers who manage systems. They possess knowledge beyond Bash scripting. In this project, you will work with APIs to access and manipulate employee data.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

General
What is an API?
What is a REST API?
What are microservices?
What is the CSV format?
What is the JSON format?
Pythonic package and module naming style.
Pythonic class naming style.
Pythonic variable naming style.
Pythonic function naming style.
Pythonic constant naming style.
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python.
Requirements
General
Recommended editors: Visual Studio Code.
All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
Ensure all your files end with a new line.
Organize imported libraries in alphabetical order.
A README.md file at the project's root folder is mandatory.
Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
The length of your files will be checked using wc.
All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').
Use get to access dictionary values by key (it won't throw an exception if the key doesn't exist).
Prevent code execution when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":).
